 Having released four successful albums, (all of which debuted at #1 on the UK album chart) Coldplay have also achieved great success with their singles, such as <a title="Coldplay &ndash; Yellow" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Yellow" class="bbcode_track">Yellow</a>, <a title="Coldplay &ndash; Speed Of Sound" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Speed+Of+Sound" class="bbcode_track">Speed Of Sound</a>, the Grammy-winning <a title="Coldplay &ndash; Clocks" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Clocks" class="bbcode_track">Clocks</a> and the US and UK #1 single <a title="Coldplay &ndash; Viva La Vida" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Viva+La+Vida" class="bbcode_track">Viva La Vida</a>.
 
 Frontman Chris Martin credits 1980s Norwegian pop band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/a-ha" class="bbcode_artist">a-ha</a> for inspiring him to form his own band.
 
 Coldplay\'s early material was often compared to that of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley" class="bbcode_artist">Jeff Buckley</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead" class="bbcode_artist">Radiohead</a>, while also drawing comparisons to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/U2" class="bbcode_artist">U2</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Travis" class="bbcode_artist">Travis</a>. Since the release of the band\'s debut album, <em><a title="Coldplay - Parachutes" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/Parachutes" class="bbcode_album">Parachutes</a></em> (2000), Coldplay has also drawn influence from other sources, including <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Echo+And+The+Bunnymen" class="bbcode_artist">Echo And The Bunnymen</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison" class="bbcode_artist">George Harrison</a> on <em><a title="Coldplay - A Rush of Blood to the Head" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/A+Rush+of+Blood+to+the+Head" class="bbcode_album">A Rush of Blood to the Head</a></em> (2002) and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash" class="bbcode_artist">Johnny Cash</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kraftwerk" class="bbcode_artist">Kraftwerk</a> for <em><a title="Coldplay - X&amp;Y" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/X%2526Y" class="bbcode_album">X&amp;Y</a></em> (2005).
 
 Coldplay are one of very few current British music acts to achieve major success in North America. Despite their large worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, refusing its use for product endorsements. In the past, Coldplay had turned down multi-million dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who wanted to use the songs &quot;Yellow&quot;, <a title="Coldplay &ndash; Trouble" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Trouble" class="bbcode_track">Trouble</a>, and <a title="Coldplay &ndash; Don\'t Panic" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Don%27t+Panic" class="bbcode_track">Don\'t Panic</a> respectively. According to Martin, &quot;We wouldn\'t be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs\' meanings like that.&quot;  On the other hand, &quot;Yellow&quot; has been used to back TV trailers for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Viva la Vida&quot; from their latest album features on the current iTunes TV advert.
 
 Since 2002, Coldplay have been active supporters of various social and political causes. They have been visible advocates of Oxfam\'s <em>Make Trade Fair</em> campaign and Amnesty International. The group has also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, and the Teenage Cancer Trust.
 
 The band has released four albums: <em>Parachutes</em> (2000), <em>A Rush Of Blood To The Head</em> (2002), <em>X&amp;Y</em> (2005), and more recently, <em><a title="Coldplay - Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/Viva+La+Vida+Or+Death+And+All+His+Friends" class="bbcode_album">Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends</a></em> (2008).
 
 At the Brit Awards 2006, Chris Martin stated that fans would not see them for a long time, suggesting it would be some time before another studio album was released, if at all. However, the previous day on Valentine\'s Day 2006, during UK Radio DJ Chris Moyles\' Breakfast show, Martin had said, &quot;The next album is very good, and I know because it is already written&quot;, and rumours were that the band would hire their own \'HQ\' studio in the style of Kraftwerk\'s Kling Klang base to record it, so it would seem there was more to come from Coldplay yet.
 
 Coldplay never intended to become England\'s favorite rock &amp; roll sons when their signature rock melodies ruled the charts throughout 2000. The quartet yearned to mess around a bit, plucking their own acoustics for fun while attending the University College of London. All had been playing instruments since their early teens and had been influenced by the likes of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan" class="bbcode_artist">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses" class="bbcode_artist">The Stone Roses</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young" class="bbcode_artist">Neil Young</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine" class="bbcode_artist">My Bloody Valentine</a>.
 
 They never imagined taking reign of the UK\'s ever-changing rock scene. Each member had come from a solid household of middle-class parents who encouraged music. Martin, the eldest of five siblings, began playing the piano as a young child. He started playing in bands around age 15 and sought solace in the words of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits" class="bbcode_artist">Tom Waits</a>. Buckland, on the other hand, was into the heavy guitar work of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton" class="bbcode_artist">Eric Clapton</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix" class="bbcode_artist">Jimi Hendrix</a> and was playing guitar by age 11. Scotland native Berryman was into <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/funk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">funk</a> instead of indie rock, therefore leaving him to play bass. The multi-instrumentalist Champion had not planned to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay. He favoured playing guitar, bass, and the tin whistle, but caught on to playing percussion when the band became official.
 
 When they burst onto the scene, Coldplay were heart-wrenching like Travis, passionate like Jeff Buckley, and as fresh as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis" class="bbcode_artist">Oasis</a>. They played their first gig at a festival for unsigned bands in Manchester, and the <em>Safety</em> EP was issued shortly thereafter. The <em>Brothers &amp; Sisters</em> EP was issued by <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Fierce+Panda" class="bbcode_label">Fierce Panda</a> and released a year later. (Both releases saw only 500 pressings.) Their sweet melodies and swooning lyrics landed Coldplay a UK deal with <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Parlophone" class="bbcode_label">Parlophone</a> in April 1999, and the five-track limited edition <em>Blue Room</em> EP followed that autumn. With nods from the media, the dream pop foursome was hailed as the next Travis, thanks to their simplistic acoustics and charming personas. Two more EPs, <em>Shiver</em> and <em>Yellow</em>, arrived in Spring 2000.
 
 Their full-length debut, <em>Parachutes</em>, earned the band a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the UK. It saw a US release in November 2000, and a month later &quot;Yellow&quot; was chosen as the theme song for all promo spots for the American TV network ABC. The well-received hype surrounding Coldplay continued throughout 2001 as well; they were nominated for three Brit Awards and embarked on a sold-out ten-date tour of the US. Rumours of a split consumed most of the US tour. Martin frequently battled nasty colds and voice exhaustion, which led Coldplay to cancel a series of American dates and scrap a European tour. With all gossip aside, Coldplay resumed playing in Summer 2001 and earned additional success with second single &quot;Trouble&quot;.
 
 By the autumn, they had headed into the studio for a second album. Rumour had it that it might be Coldplay\'s last album, since the band members felt they might not capture such brilliance again. <em>A Rush of Blood to the Head</em> was released in August 2002. The CD/DVD package <em>Live 2003</em> was issued a year later. Capturing the band\'s show at the Horden Pavilion in Sydney, <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/Australia" class="bbcode_place">Australia</a>, it highlighted Coldplay\'s monumental success worldwide with <em>A Rush of Blood to the Head</em>. Martin specifically earned a higher notch on the celebrity scale by marrying actress Gwyneth Paltrow in December 2003. Paltrow gave birth to the couple\'s first daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin, the following April.
 
 Fatherhood did not stop Martin from working, as Coldplay began recording material for a third album within weeks. Previously recorded material with longtime producer Ken Nelson was scrapped early on, while producer Danton Supple (<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey" class="bbcode_artist">Morrissey</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure" class="bbcode_artist">The Cure</a>) joined Coldplay to complete the recording of <em>X&amp;Y</em>. &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; marked Coldplay\'s first single from their long-awaited third effort in Spring 2005; the album followed in June, topping the charts around the world, including America and Britain.
 
 Coldplay\'s fourth album <em>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</em> was released on June 12, 2008 in the United Kingdom, with the first single <a title="Coldplay &ndash; Violet Hill" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Violet+Hill" class="bbcode_track">Violet Hill</a> having been previously released as a free download through their <a href="http://www.coldplay.com/" rel="nofollow">official website</a> for a week from April 29, 2008.
 
 The latest album is currently being given lots of positive feedback for its originality in melodic acoustics and slightly less \'synth-dependent\' riffs. It offers a great insight into how significantly the band\'s music has adapted and developed to themselves and the public.
 
 <em>Viva la Vida</em> was produced by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno" class="bbcode_artist">Brian Eno</a>, mixed by Markus Dravs, and drew influence from the time the group spent in South America. 
 
 Barely a week before the album was released, a duo with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue" class="bbcode_artist">Kylie Minogue</a> which was intended to be used was scrapped with the comment that \'it was too sexy\'. However, they plan to release it as a single or on a deluxe album expected at around Christmas 2008.
 
 On Dec 1, 2008, Coldplay released &quot;<a href="http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-us&amp;fg=cp_en-us_RED_redwire_launch&amp;vid=51645ad7-8279-4799-a1b9-7607dc546d13" rel="nofollow">Lhuna</a>&quot; with Kylie Minogue at the launch of the <a href="http://red.msn.com/" rel="nofollow">(RED)WIRE™</a> website to mark World AIDS Day 2008. This is the world premiere of the song.

The band is composed of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, beats), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboard, other instruments), Ed O\'Brien (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Greenwood (bass guitar) and Phil Selway (drums, percussion).
 
 Radiohead released their first single, &quot;Creep,&quot; in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead\'s popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). The band\'s textured guitar parts and Yorke\'s falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans. Radiohead\'s third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s.
 
 Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a change in the band\'s musical style. Radiohead incorporated experimental electronic music, Krautrock, post-punk and jazz influences into their songs, dividing fans and critics, but they remained popular. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of guitar-driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by headlines, was the band\'s final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), originally as a digital download for which each customer could set their own price, later in stores, to critical and chart success. Radiohead have sold approximately 30 million albums as of 2008.[1][2]

 Gotye\'s second album <a title="Gotye - Like Drawing Blood" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/Like+Drawing+Blood" class="bbcode_album">Like Drawing Blood</a> was featured by Triple J in May 2006 and was voted Number 1 in the listeners poll of the Best Album of 2006 . The album was also nominated for a J Award that year. Two tracks from that album, <a title="Gotye &ndash; Learnalilgivinanlovin" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/_/Learnalilgivinanlovin" class="bbcode_track">Learnalilgivinanlovin</a> and <a title="Gotye &ndash; Heart\'s A Mess" href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Gotye/_/Heart%27s+A+Mess" class="bbcode_track">Heart\'s A Mess</a>, were ranked 94 and 8 respectively in Triple J\'s Hottest 100 for 2006. <a title="Gotye - Like Drawing Blood" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/Like+Drawing+Blood" class="bbcode_album">Like Drawing Blood</a> has been certified Platinum. 
 
 In September 2006, Gotye was nominated for an Australian Recording Industry Music Award (ARIA award) for best independent release for his album <a title="Gotye - Like Drawing Blood" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/Like+Drawing+Blood" class="bbcode_album">Like Drawing Blood</a>, and won \'Most Outstanding New Independent Artist\' at the inaugural Australian Independent Record (AIR) Chart Awards.
 
 In 2007, Gotye won the ARIA for best male artist. As a result of the publicity of the nomination, <a title="Gotye - Like Drawing Blood" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/Like+Drawing+Blood" class="bbcode_album">Like Drawing Blood</a> re-entered the ARIA album chart and was named iTunes UK Album of the Year in 2008.

 After the success of <a title="Gotye - Like Drawing Blood" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/Like+Drawing+Blood" class="bbcode_album">Like Drawing Blood</a>, De Backer was able to establish a permanent home, still in Melbourne\'s South East. In 2010, De Backer set up a recording studio in a barn at his parents\' farm and set about recording tracks for his third album. He released a new single, <a title="Gotye &ndash; Eyes Wide Open" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/_/Eyes+Wide+Open" class="bbcode_track">Eyes Wide Open</a>, in mid-October 2010, online and on 10&quot; vinyl. The single received generally positive reviews and reached number 25 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2010. It was also shortlisted for the 2011 APRA Music Awards in the Song of the Year category.
 
 In late March 2011, De Backer revealed the album\'s title to be <a title="Gotye - Making Mirrors" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/Making+Mirrors" class="bbcode_album">Making Mirrors</a>. This title was inspired by an artwork, painted by De Backer\'s father in the 1980s, discovered by De Backer amongst old bills and newspapers in his parents\' barn, which was later edited in Photoshop to become the album artwork. &quot;The mirror reflects on artwork and it is all very related to self-reflection and introspection on the album.&quot; 
 
 On 19 May, it was announced that the album would be released on 19 August 2011, with the album launch the following day at the Sydney Opera House as part of the Graphic Festival which will feature animators and a 10-piece orchestra as part of Gotye\'s performance. De Backer also released a follow-up single to <a title="Gotye &ndash; Eyes Wide Open" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/_/Eyes+Wide+Open" class="bbcode_track">Eyes Wide Open</a> titled <a title="Gotye &ndash; Somebody That I Used To Know" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/_/Somebody+That+I+Used+To+Know" class="bbcode_track">Somebody That I Used To Know</a>, which was released 6 July 2011, and debuted at #27 on the ARIA Top 50 Singles Chart. The single became something of a sensation, quickly moving up the ARIA singles chart despite comparatively low airplay to many other charting singles at the time. The track was further boosted by endorsements from well-known celebrities Ashton Kutcher and Lily Allen via Twitter, exposing Gotye\'s music to their millions of followers. The single has gone on to reach 6× Platinum (420,000 units sold) status.
 
 On 15 July 2011, it was announced that Gotye\'s single <a title="Gotye &ndash; Somebody That I Used To Know" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/_/Somebody+That+I+Used+To+Know" class="bbcode_track">Somebody That I Used To Know</a> had come third in the 2011 Vanda &amp; Young Songwriting Competition. As part of the prize, Gotye won a spot to perform at Song Summit 2012 at Darling Harbour, 26–28 May 2012.
 
 On its first week of release, <a title="Gotye - Making Mirrors" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/Making+Mirrors" class="bbcode_album">Making Mirrors</a> came in at number one on the ARIA Australian album chart, making Gotye the first Australian act to simultaneously hold both the number one single and album since <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Silverchair" class="bbcode_artist">Silverchair</a>, who achieved the same feat in 2007.
 
 On 11 October 2011, it was announced that Gotye had been nominated for seven ARIA Awards. Due to the release date restrictions of the eligibility period, <a title="Gotye - Making Mirrors" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/Making+Mirrors" class="bbcode_album">Making Mirrors</a> could not be nominated, and the seven nominations all related to the single <a title="Gotye &ndash; Somebody That I Used To Know" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gotye/_/Somebody+That+I+Used+To+Know" class="bbcode_track">Somebody That I Used To Know</a>. Gotye was nominated for Highest Selling Single, Single of the Year, Best Pop Release, Best Male Artist and three awards in the ARIA Artisan category: Best Video (Natasha Pincus), Engineer of the Year (Francois Tetaz) and Producer of the Year (Wally De Backer). On the same day the nominations were revealed, the winners of the Artisan categories were announced, with Gotye and the album personnel winning all three. On 27 November 2011, Gotye took out three of the four remaining ARIA Award nominations. Single of the Year, Best Male Artist and Best Pop Release. 
 
 &quot;Somebody That I Used To Know&quot; has become an international hit, reaching #1 in Australia, Belgium, United Kingdom, Poland, Austria, Ireland, Norway, The Netherlands, New Zealand and Germany, and also reached #1 on the alternative radio airplay charts in The United States and Canada (on the pop charts in those countries, the song has reached #5 and #11, respectively).

Her debut album, <a title="Adele - 19" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/19" class="bbcode_album">19</a>, was released in January 2008 and entered the UK album chart at #1. The album has since received four-times Platinum certification in the UK and has sold 5,500,000 copies worldwide. The album included the hugely popular song <a title="Adele &ndash; Chasing Pavements" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/_/Chasing+Pavements" class="bbcode_track">Chasing Pavements</a>. 19 earned Adele two Grammy Awards in February 2009 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. 
 
 Her second album, <a title="Adele - 21" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/21" class="bbcode_album">21</a>, was released on January 24th 2011 in the UK and propelled Adele to unprecedented mega-stardom. In just eleven months, 21 received fourteen-times Platinum certification in the UK for shipments in excess of 4,500,000 copies, and has sold a further 6,200,000 copies in the US denoting sextuple-Platinum status. As of January 2012, 21 has sold an estimated seventeen million copies worldwide. The album has produced three global chart-topping singles thus far: <a title="Adele &ndash; Rolling In The Deep" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/_/Rolling+In+The+Deep" class="bbcode_track">Rolling In The Deep</a>, <a title="Adele &ndash; Someone Like You" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/_/Someone+Like+You" class="bbcode_track">Someone Like You</a>, and <a title="Adele &ndash; Set Fire To The Rain" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/_/Set+Fire+To+The+Rain" class="bbcode_track">Set Fire To The Rain</a>. 21 won Adele six awards at the 2012 Grammy Awards, among them Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.
 
 Adele graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in May 2006, where she was classmates with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Leona+Lewis" class="bbcode_artist">Leona Lewis</a>. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent. In school, she was more interested in going into A&amp;R, and hoped to launch other people\'s careers. Four months later, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend who posted it on Myspace where it became very successful and led to a phone call from music label <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/XL+Recordings" class="bbcode_label">XL Recordings</a>. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Virgin+Records" class="bbcode_label">Virgin Records</a>, and she took a friend with her to the meeting. Nick Huggett at <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/XL+Recordings" class="bbcode_label">XL Recordings</a> recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management and in June 2006 Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major attraction for Adele who was a big fan of the English singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/XL+Recordings" class="bbcode_label">XL Recordings</a> in September 2006.
 
 Adele\'s breakthrough song, <a title="Adele &ndash; Hometown Glory" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/_/Hometown+Glory" class="bbcode_track">Hometown Glory</a>, was released in October 2007. Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate\'s song, My Yvonne, from his debut album.

				VALUES ('The Beatles', 'http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/500/880929/The+Beatles.jpg', '<strong>The Beatles</strong> were an iconic rock group from Liverpool, England. They are frequently cited as the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in modern history, with innovative music, a cultural impact that helped define the 1960s and an enormous influence on music that is still felt today. Currently, The Beatles are one of the two musical acts to sell more than 1 billion records, with only Elvis Presley having been able to achieve the same feat.
      
 After conquering Europe, with successful tours to Germany and Sweden, the Beatles led the mid-1960s musical \'British Invasion\' into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored a great variety of musical styles including Psychedelic Rock, Experimental, Ballads, Western and Indian Classical among others. Their clothes, hairstyles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. 
      
 Early on, the band consisted of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison" class="bbcode_artist">George Harrison</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon" class="bbcode_artist">John Lennon</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney" class="bbcode_artist">Paul McCartney</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stuart+Sutcliffe" class="bbcode_artist">Stuart Sutcliffe</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Best" class="bbcode_artist">Pete Best</a>. The band got its first major break playing in Hamburg, Germany, at some rather seedy nightclubs, beginning in 1960. While in Germany, they also met Klaus Voormann, who would later design the cover of the group\'s 1966 album Revolver. Stuart remained in Germany after the others decided to return to England, and became engaged to fellow artist Astrid Kirchherr, only to die a few years later of a brain hemorrhage. 
 
 In 1961, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Epstein" class="bbcode_artist">Brian Epstein</a> heard their sound and was thrilled enough to sign on as their manager, even though he had no previous experience in that field.  His efforts eventually led, in 1962, to an audition with EMI producer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/George+Martin" class="bbcode_artist">George Martin</a>, who signed them to EMI\'s Parlaphone label. 
 
 Later, due in part to Martin\'s refusal to use him on recordings, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Best" class="bbcode_artist">Pete Best</a> was replaced by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Starr" class="bbcode_artist">Ringo Starr</a>, the drummer from another big Liverpool band known as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rory+Storm" class="bbcode_artist">Rory Storm</a> and the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Hurricanes" class="bbcode_artist">Hurricanes</a>. Ringo was supposed to play on their first single, &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Love Me Do" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Love+Me+Do" class="bbcode_track">Love Me Do</a>&quot;, but <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/George+Martin" class="bbcode_artist">George Martin</a> had <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+White" class="bbcode_artist">Alan White</a>, a session drummer, play instead (Ringo can be heard on the album version of the song).
      
 In 1963, The Beatles initiated a craze known as &quot;Beatlemania&quot; in the UK with the song &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Please Please Me" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Please+Please+Me" class="bbcode_track">Please Please Me</a>&quot;. Their first album of the same title was recorded in just one day. This fame spread internationally and, in February of 1964, they arrived in the United States. Their first appearance in the States was on the Ed Sullivan Show, following &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; I Want to Hold Your Hand" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/I+Want+to+Hold+Your+Hand" class="bbcode_track">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>&quot; going #1 in the States. With this success, the Beatles released two feature length films within the space of two years: <em>A Hard Day\'s Night</em> and <em>Help!</em>. The songs from both films were penned by Lennon and McCartney, and albums followed their release. In <em>Help!</em>, the Beatles were given greater creative freedom, deciding for example to head to the exotic location of the Bahamas simply to shoot one scene.  
      
 The Beatles were comprised of four members in the long run: <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon" class="bbcode_artist">John Lennon</a> (vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney" class="bbcode_artist">Paul McCartney</a> (vocals, bass guitar, piano, guitar), <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison" class="bbcode_artist">George Harrison</a> (lead guitar, vocals), and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Starr" class="bbcode_artist">Ringo Starr</a> (percussion, vocals). Lennon and McCartney were the main songwriters and singers, although songs penned by George started showing up more frequently on later albums. Ringo traditionally sang one song on each record. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/George+Martin" class="bbcode_artist">George Martin</a> produced most of the Beatles\' records, and was a highly influential part of the band\'s sound on most of their records. He also played the renowned solo on &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; In My Life" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/In+My+Life" class="bbcode_track">In My Life</a>&quot; (<a title="The Beatles - Rubber Soul" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Rubber+Soul" class="bbcode_album">Rubber Soul</a>). 
      
 For years, The Beatles showed an amazing talent for writing hit after hit. In 1966, they ceased performing in concert (apparently they grew weary of the constant screaming from the fans, which always got so loud they could never hear themselves play; another contributing factor was the extraordinary lengths they had to go to for security reasons before and after each performance) and began exploring new sounds in the studio. This is especially apparent in albums such as <em><a title="The Beatles - Rubber Soul" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Rubber+Soul" class="bbcode_album">Rubber Soul</a></em>, <em><a title="The Beatles - Revolver" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Revolver" class="bbcode_album">Revolver</a></em>, <em><a title="The Beatles - Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Sgt.+Pepper%27s+Lonely+Hearts+Club+Band" class="bbcode_album">Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em> and <em><a title="The Beatles - The Beatles" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/The+Beatles" class="bbcode_album">The Beatles</a></em>, sometimes known as &quot;The White Album&quot;. The White Album  is considered the band\'s most experimental. The novel sounds featured are due to the growing presence of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Yoko+Ono" class="bbcode_artist">Yoko Ono</a> (Lennon\'s wife), as demonstrated by the song &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Revolution 9" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Revolution+9" class="bbcode_track">Revolution 9</a>&quot;, and the band\'s increasing use of drugs. The song &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Lucy+in+the+Sky+With+Diamonds" class="bbcode_track">Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds</a>&quot; (off of Sgt. Pepper\'s) was rumored to be an ode to LSD, although the band vehemently denied any link; they instead insisted that it described a drawing made by John Lennon\'s son, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Julian+Lennon" class="bbcode_artist">Julian Lennon</a>. After the death of Brian Epstein, the Beatles began to unravel at the seams. The Beatles officially split at the dawn of 1970; Lennon had unofficially quit the previous year and the band had maintained the front of being together to protect their business interests. McCartney, who was the first to announce that he had officially &quot;quit&quot; the band and that they no longer existed, was often blamed for the band\'s ending although by the end he was the only one willing to carry on and was, by stating the group no longer existed, admitting to the facts.  
      
 The Beatles never reunited properly in the 1970s as they never fully recovered from the acrimony associated with their breakup. They did, however, make two new records in 1994, despite Lennon\'s 1980 death, for the Anthology project. &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Free as a Bird" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Free+as+a+Bird" class="bbcode_track">Free as a Bird</a>&quot; and &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Real Love" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Real+Love" class="bbcode_track">Real Love</a>&quot; were based on demo tapes made by Lennon and sent to McCartney by his widow Yoko Ono. They charted in the UK at #2 and #4 respectively.
   
 The Beatles also created some of the first music videos, having filmed promotional films in 1965 for broadcasters to show across the US and Europe rather than have to appear live. Their 1967 film promos for &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Strawberry Fields Forever" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Strawberry+Fields+Forever" class="bbcode_track">Strawberry Fields Forever</a>&quot; and &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Penny Lane" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Penny+Lane" class="bbcode_track">Penny Lane</a>&quot; have even more similarity to modern music videos, with each one created for just the individual song, and without the appearance of being a recording of a live performance. 
 
 The Beatles were also the source of a number of controversies and conspiracy theories. John Lennon was quoted in 1966 as saying the Beatles were &quot;more popular than Jesus Christ&quot;, causing protests in many parts of the USA; although he publicly apologized for the statement, he also later claimed it was a contributing factor in the Beatles ending touring. 
 
 A widespread urban legend that started in 1969 claimed that Paul McCartney was dead and had been replaced by a lookalike. The rumor was referred to by members of the Beatles a number of times, including John Lennon\'s song &quot;<a title="John Lennon &ndash; How Do You Sleep?" href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/How+Do+You+Sleep%3F" class="bbcode_track">How Do You Sleep?</a>&quot;.
    
 George Harrison passed away in 2001. His death was marked by a large concert event in the Albert Hall. The Concert for George took place a year to the day of George\'s death. Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney continue to make music. Ringo released <em><a title="Ringo Starr - Choose Love" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Starr/Choose+Love" class="bbcode_album">Choose Love</a></em> and Paul released <em><a title="Paul McCartney - Chaos And Creation In The Backyard" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney/Chaos+And+Creation+In+The+Backyard" class="bbcode_album">Chaos And Creation In The Backyard</a></em> both in 2005. Paul\'s latest release is 2007\'s <em><a title="Paul McCartney - Memory Almost Full" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney/Memory+Almost+Full" class="bbcode_album">Memory Almost Full</a></em>. Also in 2008 Ringo released Liverpool 8.
 
 George Harrison once said “The Beatles will exist without us.” Deftly short and simple, this quote surmises their legacy, showing how The Beatles as an entity transcends not only the music or entertainment industry, but even the members themselves. 
      
 In 2006, a collaboration between Apple Corps, and Cirque du Soleil, culminated in a show called <em><a title="The Beatles - Love" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Love" class="bbcode_album">Love</a></em>, showing only in Las Vegas. Starr, McCartney, Ono and Harrison\'s widow, Olivia, all were involved in the production. The accompanying album is composed of new takes on original Beatles recordings, spliced together and creating new feels for several of their songs. The project was put together by renowned Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles.  
      
 The tracks in &quot;Love&quot; contain parts from original Beatles demo recordings, and George Martin created a new orchestral arrangement for an acoustic demo version of Harrison\'s &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; While My Guitar Gently Weeps" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/While+My+Guitar+Gently+Weeps" class="bbcode_track">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>&quot;. 
 
 In October 2007, <em>Across the Universe</em>, a musical film which incorporated Beatles songs into its narrative, was released in cinemas to mixed reviews. The film incorporates, and indeed appears to be built around, various songs throughout the Beatles\' career, sung by the principles. Songs such as &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; I Want to Hold Your Hand" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/I+Want+to+Hold+Your+Hand" class="bbcode_track">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>&quot; and &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Dear Prudence" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Dear+Prudence" class="bbcode_track">Dear Prudence</a>&quot; actually tell the story at hand, while songs such as &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Let It Be" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Let+It+Be" class="bbcode_track">Let It Be</a>&quot; and &quot;<a title="The Beatles &ndash; Across the Universe" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Across+the+Universe" class="bbcode_track">Across the Universe</a>&quot; seem instead to provide a background or atmosphere around which the story is built.

 The Chili Peppers\' original guitarist, Slovak, was replaced in 1984 by Jack Sherman, while Slovak and Irons recorded music with their band at the time, &quot;What Is This?&quot; Upon Slovak\'s return, Sherman was fired from the band. 
 
 Following Slovak\'s death of a heroin overdose, a young John Frusciante took over as guitarist in 1988. Frusciante, however, quit the band in 1992 due in part to his sadness at the band becoming so successful in such a short time; complex personal issues, involving an addiction to heroin, were also a factor. He was then replaced by Arik Marshall. Approximately a year later, Marshall left the band, to be replaced by former <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jane%27s+Addiction" class="bbcode_artist">Jane\'s Addiction</a> guitarist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Navarro" class="bbcode_artist">Dave Navarro</a>.
 
 After the release of 1995\'s One Hot Minute, Navarro\'s escalating drug habits became a subject of conflict. In 1998, Navarro was fired from the band, to be taken over by none other than former guitarist, Frusciante, who remained in the band until 2008, when he quietly took his leave on good terms with the other members.
 
 Founder and guitarist Hillel Slovak did not actually appear on the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/The+Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers">self-titled debut album</a>, despite performing and writing the content with the band prior to recording. He was replaced by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Sherman" class="bbcode_artist">Jack Sherman</a> for the recording of the album, but returned to the band for second album, <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Freaky+Styley">Freaky Styley</a></em>.

 Frusciante has also been making solo albums for a number of years. His new album with the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ataxia" class="bbcode_artist">Ataxia</a> came out May 2007, and is titled <em><a title="Ataxia - Automatic Writing II" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ataxia/Automatic+Writing+II" class="bbcode_album">Automatic Writing II</a></em>.
 
 In 2003 Flea played bass on <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Mars+Volta" class="bbcode_artist">The Mars Volta</a>\'s album <em>Deloused In The Comatorium</em>. Frusciante added guitar to tracks on Deloused and 2005\'s <em>Frances The Mute</em>. He also played rhythm guitar on The Mars Volta\'s <em>Amputechture</em>. Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez, guitarist for The Mars Volta, appeared on <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Stadium+Arcadium">Stadium Arcadium</a></em>, playing the solo on &quot;Especially In Michigan&quot;.
 
 In 2011, the band released  <em>I\'m With You</em>, their tenth studio album, and their first with guitarist Josh Klinghoffer.
 
 A new era in the band\'s history took place due Frusciante\'s departure in 2009. He was replaced by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Josh+Klinghoffer" class="bbcode_artist">Josh Klinghoffer</a>, who had already played shows as a second guitarist with the band during their 2007 tour dates.

Her song <a title="Rihanna &ndash; Umbrella" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Umbrella" class="bbcode_track">Umbrella</a> was one of the highest-selling songs of 2007 and her 3rd album <a title="Rihanna - Good Girl Gone Bad" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/Good+Girl+Gone+Bad" class="bbcode_album">Good Girl Gone Bad</a> was critically acclaimed, helping propel her to superstar status. She has attained eleven Billboard Hot 100 number ones thus far and is the second Bajan artist to win a Grammy Award. She is also a cultural ambassador for Barbados.
 
 Rihanna was born in Saint Michael, Barbados to Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor, and Monica Fenty, an accountant.  Her mother, a native of Guyana, is Afro-Guyanese and her father is Bajan and Irish. She is the oldest of three siblings; two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty.  She began singing at around the age of seven.  Her childhood was deeply affected by her father\'s addiction to crack cocaine and parent\'s rocky marriage, which ended when she was fourteen years old.  Rihanna attended Charles F. Broome Memorial School, a primary school in Barbados, and then the Combermere School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates at the age of fifteen.  In 2004 she won the Miss Combermere Beauty Pageant.  She was an army cadet in a sub-military programme that trained with the military of Barbados and Shontelle was her drill sergeant.
 
 At the age of 15, she formed a girl group with two of her classmates.  In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing in Barbados with his wife.  The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that &quot;the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn\'t exist.&quot;   While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang Destiny\'s Child\'s cover of &quot;Emotion&quot;.  Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with Rogers and his wife.  Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; The Last Time" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/The+Last+Time" class="bbcode_track">The Last Time</a>,&quot; a cover of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Whitney+Houston" class="bbcode_artist">Whitney Houston</a>’s hit &quot;<a title="Whitney Houston &ndash; For the Love of You" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Whitney+Houston/_/For+the+Love+of+You" class="bbcode_track">For the Love of You</a>&quot; and what would become her first hit, &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Pon de Replay" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Pon+de+Replay" class="bbcode_track">Pon de Replay</a>&quot; to send to various recording companies.  It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna\'s demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her to audition for the label\'s then-president, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jay-Z" class="bbcode_artist">Jay-Z</a>, who quickly signed her.
 
 Rihanna broke into the recording industry in 2005 with the release of her debut album <a title="Rihanna - Music Of The Sun" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/Music+Of+The+Sun" class="bbcode_album">Music Of The Sun</a>, which features the number 2 hit single &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Pon de Replay" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Pon+de+Replay" class="bbcode_track">Pon de Replay</a>&quot;.  Less than a year later, Rihanna released <a title="Rihanna - A Girl Like Me" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/A+Girl+Like+Me" class="bbcode_album">A Girl Like Me</a> and earned her first number-one single, &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; SOS" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/SOS" class="bbcode_track">SOS</a>, which sampled the popular 80s track &quot;Tainted Love&quot;.  &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Unfaithful" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Unfaithful" class="bbcode_track">Unfaithful</a>&quot; was also released and was fairly successful.
 
 Rihanna released her third album, <a title="Rihanna - Good Girl Gone Bad" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/Good+Girl+Gone+Bad" class="bbcode_album">Good Girl Gone Bad</a>, in June 2007. Prior to the release of the album, she spent the week of the Grammys writing songs for the album with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ne-Yo" class="bbcode_artist">Ne-Yo</a>.  She adopted a more sexual image while recording the album, eventually dying her hair black and cutting it short. Rihanna worked with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Timbaland" class="bbcode_artist">Timbaland</a> and Christopher &quot;<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tricky" class="bbcode_artist">Tricky</a>&quot; Stewart, as well as previous musical collaborators such as Stargate, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers to re-imagine her album compositions with uptempo dance tracks. Rihanna commented, &quot;I want to keep people dancing but still be soulful at the same time.  You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs].&quot;
 
 The album topped the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Russia and Ireland, and peaked at number two in the United States and Australia.  Unlike previous work, the album featured a more dance-pop sound instead of the dancehall, reggae and ballad styles. The album received positive reviews by critics, becoming her most critically acclaimed album at that time compared to her previous efforts.
 
 It yielded eight hit singles - &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Umbrella" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Umbrella" class="bbcode_track">Umbrella</a>&quot;  &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Shut Up and Drive" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Shut+Up+and+Drive" class="bbcode_track">Shut Up and Drive</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Don\'t Stop the Music" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Don%27t+Stop+the+Music" class="bbcode_track">Don\'t Stop the Music</a>&quot; &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Hate That I Love You" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Hate+That+I+Love+You" class="bbcode_track">Hate That I Love You</a>&quot; &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Rehab" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Rehab" class="bbcode_track">Rehab</a>&quot; &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Disturbia" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Disturbia" class="bbcode_track">Disturbia</a>&quot; &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Take a Bow" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Take+a+Bow" class="bbcode_track">Take a Bow</a>&quot; &quot;<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/If+I+Never+See+Your+Face+Again+%28feat.+Maroon+5%29">If I Never See Your Face Again</a>&quot; - all singles reaching the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 — including the worldwide number-one hit &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Umbrella" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Umbrella" class="bbcode_track">Umbrella</a>,&quot; featuring <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jay-Z" class="bbcode_artist">Jay-Z</a>.  
 
 In addition to reaching number one in various countries, &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Umbrella" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Umbrella" class="bbcode_track">Umbrella</a>&quot; was the number one single in the United Kingdom for ten consecutive weeks, making it the longest-running number-one single since <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Wet+Wet+Wet" class="bbcode_artist">Wet Wet Wet</a>\'s single &quot;<a title="Wet Wet Wet &ndash; Love Is All Around" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Wet+Wet+Wet/_/Love+Is+All+Around" class="bbcode_track">Love Is All Around</a>&quot; spent fifteen weeks at the top in 1994.  The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007 published by Rolling Stone magazine.  In 2008, &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Umbrella" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Umbrella" class="bbcode_track">Umbrella</a>&quot; earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It managed to stay at number one in the United Kingdom for 10 weeks, the longest time spent by a female and in the 21st century, on this chart.
 
 &quot;<a title="Rihanna &ndash; Umbrella" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Umbrella" class="bbcode_track">Umbrella</a>&quot; has also been recognised in various forms of accolades by the music press. The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007, published by the music magazine Rolling Stone. Time magazine also listed the song number three on their Top 10 Songs of 2007.

				VALUES ('David Guetta', 'http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/500/67992730/David+Guetta+PNG.png', '<strong>David Guetta</strong> (born November 7th, 1967 in Paris) is a French DJ.
 
 He was the pioneer of French house with &quot;<a title="David Guetta &ndash; Up &amp; away" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/Up%2B%2526%2Baway" class="bbcode_track">Up &amp; away</a>,&quot; a garage-style track with vocals by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Owens" class="bbcode_artist">Robert Owens</a> released in 1994 – really made a name for himself in the mid-90s as one of the key catalysts of Parisian nightlife by promoting evenings at such renowned Paris hot spots as Folies Pigalle, Queen, Bataclan, Palace and Les Bains, where he invited DJ legends like Little Louie Vega, David Morales, DJ Pierre and Roger Sanchez to join him on the turntables. In 2001, however, he went back to his first love: making music.
 
 Launched by the single &quot;<a title="David Guetta &ndash; Just A Little More Love" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/Just+A+Little+More+Love" class="bbcode_track">Just A Little More Love</a>,&quot; an electro-funk-house cocktail featuring <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Willis" class="bbcode_artist">Chris Willis</a> of the band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/nashville" class="bbcode_artist">nashville</a> on vocals, David Guetta’s first album was released by <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Virgin" class="bbcode_label">Virgin</a> in June 2002 and went on to sell 250,000 copies. This resounding success carried through in the album\'s second, even more devastating single, &quot;<a title="David Guetta &ndash; Love Don\'t Let Me Go" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/Love+Don%27t+Let+Me+Go" class="bbcode_track">Love Don\'t Let Me Go</a>,&quot; a track reminiscent of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Moroder" class="bbcode_artist">Moroder</a>\'s techno-disco style crossed with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode" class="bbcode_artist">Depeche Mode</a>\'s new-wave sound.
 
 Like fellow Frenchman <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Laurent+Garnier" class="bbcode_artist">Laurent Garnier</a>, David started off his career in the gay clubs around Paris. Les Halles district in the mid-80s, going on to make a name for himself in acid-house and hip-hop. His first album heralded the beginning of a new DJ career – this time on a global level. Named after the parties he hosts on Ibiza, the fabled isle of techno, David\'s &quot;F*** ME I\'M FAMOUS: IBIZA DJ MIX&quot;, which featured his remix of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie" class="bbcode_artist">David Bowie</a>\'s &quot;<a title="David Guetta &ndash; Heroes" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/Heroes" class="bbcode_track">Heroes</a>,&quot; went gold: no small feat for a compilation CD. For the last three years, David has been invited to mix throughout Europe on a regular basis and, more and more often, in the United States, Australia, Japan, Singapore and Israel as well. He is also resident DJ at The Cross in London, Barcelona ‘s Discoteca and the Lausanne club Mad.
 
 Propelled by the rock guitars of the single Money, David’s second album, <em><a title="David Guetta - Guetta Blaster" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/Guetta+Blaster" class="bbcode_album">Guetta Blaster</a></em>, is even gutsier. David and Joachim Garraud (the first album’s co-composer and co-producer) applied themselves to creating real songs modeled on electro-pop classics of the 80s by such masters as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode" class="bbcode_artist">Depeche Mode</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Yazoo" class="bbcode_artist">Yazoo</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Or+Alive" class="bbcode_artist">Dead Or Alive</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/New+Order" class="bbcode_artist">New Order</a>, to name the most prominent influences. All the tracks on this second album are original compositions. The gospel sounds of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Willis" class="bbcode_artist">Chris Willis</a> and the stylings of guest vocalists <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/JD+Davis" class="bbcode_artist">JD Davis</a> (lead singer of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Sinema" class="bbcode_artist">Sinema</a>), James Perry (alias <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Polo" class="bbcode_artist">Jimmy Polo</a>, renowned singer/producer on the Chicago scene) and Britain’s <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Stereo+MCs" class="bbcode_artist">Stereo MCs</a> give the tracks a unique luster, while the production skills of Guetta and Garraud lift the album to new – and always spectacular – heights.
 
 From <em>GUETTA BLASTER</em>’s opening salvos, &quot;<span title="Unknown track" class="bbcode_unknown">Money and Stay</span>,&quot; we get beats that are cranked up a notch beyond the hard-dance formula of &quot;<a title="David Guetta &ndash; Just A Little More Love" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/Just+A+Little+More+Love" class="bbcode_track">Just A Little More Love</a>.&quot; Without an ounce of hesitation, the album launches itself at the experimental roots of house music and cold-wave, displaying an unexpected stylistic versatility, then oscillates between powerful mixtures of hot &amp; cold and black &amp; white. The result is 100% addictive.
 
 &quot;<a title="David Guetta &ndash; Used to Be the One" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/Used+to+Be+the+One" class="bbcode_track">Used to Be the One</a>,&quot; with vocals by Willis, owes a debt to both Yazoo’s Don\'t Go and garage music. Similarly, the counterpoint of Time evokes Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams, blending the best of English pop and dance culture – something David has mastered like no one else. Open Your Eyes, a track tailor-made for the Stereo MCs, is built on a rubbery break beat and an acid sequence, with a rap that brings their classic Connected to mind. The abrasive AC/DC, clearly a future hit on the underground/rave circuit, is like the missing link between Jeff Mills and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ministry+of+Sound" class="bbcode_artist">Ministry of Sound</a>.
 
 Two velvet-smooth cuts neatly crown the album: &quot;<a title="David Guetta &ndash; In Love With Myself" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/In+Love+With+Myself" class="bbcode_track">In Love With Myself</a>,&quot; a track that could hold its own against Moroder &amp; Oakey’s Electric Dreams any day, is followed by &quot;<a title="David Guetta &ndash; Higher" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/Higher" class="bbcode_track">Higher</a>,&quot; on which Chris Willis pays homage to the style of phrasing and embellishment popularized by Stevie Wonder, an approach that has proliferated in both R&amp;B and garage/house music à la New Jersey duo Blaze. GUETTA BLASTER drives its point home with the metronomic Movement Girl, featuring James Perry, and the killer Get Up, on which macho riffs, the hysterical falsetto of Chris Willis and screaming guitars swirl around a punchy beat.
 On GUETTA BLASTER, David Guetta has not only successfully avoided the pitfalls of second albums – he has truly launched himself into a new dimension.
 The song &quot;<a title="David Guetta &ndash; Just A Little More Love" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/Just+A+Little+More+Love" class="bbcode_track">Just A Little More Love</a>&quot; appeared in the film <em>The Football Factory</em>, was sung in the Gospel version at the 2006 Victoria\'s Secret Fashion Show.
 On New Year\'s Day 2007 he appeared at Big Beach Boutique 3, a concert held on the beach of Brighton, UK, put together by and headlined by Fatboy Slim.
 His fourth album is &quot;Pop Life&quot; released in France on 23 April, 2007 with the leading single
 &quot;<a title="David Guetta &ndash; Love Is Gone" href="http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/Love+Is+Gone" class="bbcode_track">Love Is Gone</a>.&quot;
 
 24. August 2009. he released &quot;One Love&quot;. He introduces this album with the hit singles &quot;When Love Takes Over&quot; feat. Kelly Rowland and &quot;Sexy Bitch/Chick&quot; feat. Akon. He wanted to make a new music stream named House Pop or Hip House. In this album he worked with well known vocalists, producers and DJs like Chris Willis, Estelle, Kid Cudi, Novel, Ne-Yo, Will I Am &amp; Apl De Ap from The Black Eyed Peas, Lil\' John, DJ Chuckie, Abel Ramos, Koen Groenveld, Afrojack, DJ Footloose, Joachim Garraud and others.

Grohl held back these songs from the band; he said in 1997, &quot;I was in awe of frontman <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kurt+Cobain" class="bbcode_artist">Kurt Cobain</a>\'s songs. And intimidated. I thought it was best that I keep my songs to myself.&quot; Instead, Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos, and even issued a cassette of some of those songs called Pocketwatch under the pseudonym &quot;Late!&quot; in 1992.
 
 Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a> subsequently disbanded. Grohl received offers to work with various artists, and almost accepted a permanent position as the drummer in <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Petty+and+the+Heartbreakers" class="bbcode_artist">Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers</a>. Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered a studio in October 1994 to record twelve of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on &quot;X-Static&quot; by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. &quot;I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life,&quot; Grohl later said. &quot;I thought that I would rather do what no-one expected me to do. I enjoy writing music and I enjoy trying to sing, and there\'s nothing anyone can really do to discourage me.&quot; Grohl completed an album\'s worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for feedback.
 
 Grohl hoped to keep his anonymity and release the recordings in a limited run under the title &quot;Foo Fighters&quot;, taken from the World War II term &quot;foo fighter&quot;, used to refer to unidentified flying objects. According to <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=22202" rel="nofollow">Rope Songfacts</a>, he was reading a book about military World War II sightings at the time and he wanted people to think it was a band. So he called it Foo Fighters as it was plural. However, the demo tape circulated in the music industry, creating interest among record labels. Grohl formed a band to support the album. Initially, Grohl talked to former <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a> band mate <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Krist+Novoselic" class="bbcode_artist">Krist Novoselic</a> about joining the group, but both decided against it. &quot;For Krist and I, it would have felt really natural and really great&quot;, Grohl explained. &quot;But for everyone else, it would have been weird, and it would have left me in a really bad position. Then I really would have been under the microscope.&quot; Having heard about the disbanding of Seattle-based emo band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Sunny+Day+Real+Estate" class="bbcode_artist">Sunny Day Real Estate</a>, Grohl drafted the group\'s bass player, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nate+Mendel" class="bbcode_artist">Nate Mendel</a>, and drummer, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/William+Goldsmith" class="bbcode_artist">William Goldsmith</a>. Grohl asked <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Smear" class="bbcode_artist">Pat Smear</a>, who served touring guitarist for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a> after the release of its 1993 album <a title="Nirvana - In Utero" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/In+Utero" class="bbcode_album">In Utero</a>, to join as the group\'s second guitarist. Grohl ultimately licensed the album to Capitol Records, releasing it on his new record label, <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Roswell+Records" class="bbcode_label">Roswell Records</a>.
 
 The group played its debut show at a keg party in February 1995. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album. Foo Fighters undertook their first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Watt" class="bbcode_artist">Mike Watt</a>. The band\'s first single &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; This Is A Call" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/This+Is+A+Call" class="bbcode_track">This Is A Call</a>&quot; was released in June 1995, and its debut album <a title="Foo Fighters - Foo Fighters" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Foo+Fighters" class="bbcode_album">Foo Fighters</a> was released the next month. &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; I\'ll Stick Around" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/I%27ll+Stick+Around" class="bbcode_track">I\'ll Stick Around</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; For All The Cows" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/For+All+The+Cows" class="bbcode_track">For All The Cows</a>&quot; and &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Big Me" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Big+Me" class="bbcode_track">Big Me</a>&quot; were released as subsequent singles. The band spent the following months on tour, including their first appearance at the Reading Festival in England in August.
 
 <strong>The Colour and the Shape</strong>
 After touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered a studio in Woodinville, Washington with producer Gil Norton to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he wasn\'t happy with how the mixes were turning out, and the band &quot;basically re-recorded almost everything&quot;. During the L.A. sessions, Grohl played drums on some of the songs. Goldsmith said Grohl did not tell him that he recorded new drum parts for the record and, feeling betrayed, left the band.
 
 In need of a replacement for Goldsmith, Grohl contacted <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Alanis+Morissette" class="bbcode_artist">Alanis Morissette</a>\'s touring drummer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Hawkins" class="bbcode_artist">Taylor Hawkins</a> to see if he could recommend anybody. Grohl was surprised when Hawkins volunteered his own services as drummer. Hawkins made his debut with the group in time for the release of its second album, <a title="Foo Fighters - The Colour and the Shape" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/The+Colour+and+the+Shape" class="bbcode_album">The Colour and the Shape</a>, in May 1997. The album spawned the singles &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Monkey Wrench" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Monkey+Wrench" class="bbcode_track">Monkey Wrench</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; My Hero" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/My+Hero" class="bbcode_track">My Hero</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Everlong" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Everlong" class="bbcode_track">Everlong</a>&quot;.
 
 <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Smear" class="bbcode_artist">Pat Smear</a> announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band to pursue other interests. Four months later in September 1997 at the MTV Video Music Awards, Smear simultaneously publicly announced his departure from the band and introduced his replacement, Grohl\'s former <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Scream" class="bbcode_artist">Scream</a> bandmate <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Franz+Stahl" class="bbcode_artist">Franz Stahl</a>. Stahl toured with the band for the next few months, and appeared on two tracks that the band recorded for movie soundtracks, a re-recording of &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Walking After You" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Walking+After+You" class="bbcode_track">Walking After You</a>&quot; for The X-Files and &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; A320" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/A320" class="bbcode_track">A320</a>&quot; for Godzilla.
 
 <strong>There Is Nothing Left to Lose</strong>
 In 1998, Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl\'s home state of Virginia to write music for its third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, &quot;In those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn\'t&quot;. Grohl was distraught about the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band\'s third album, <a title="Foo Fighters - There Is Nothing Left to Lose" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/There+Is+Nothing+Left+to+Lose" class="bbcode_album">There Is Nothing Left to Lose</a>, in Grohl\'s Virginia home studio. The album spawned several singles, including &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Learn to Fly" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Learn+to+Fly" class="bbcode_track">Learn to Fly</a>&quot;, the band\'s first single to reach the US Hot 100.
 
 Before the release of the album, <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Capitol" class="bbcode_label">Capitol</a> president Gary Gersh was forced out of the label. Given Grohl\'s history with Gersh, Foo Fighters\' contract had included a &quot;key man clause&quot; that allowed them to leave the label upon Gersh\'s departure. They subsequently left <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Capitol" class="bbcode_label">Capitol</a> and signed to <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/rca" class="bbcode_label">rca</a>, who later acquired the rights to the band\'s <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Capitol" class="bbcode_label">Capitol</a> albums.
 Chris Shiflett joined Foo Fighters as a touring guitarist before becoming a full member
 
 After recording was completed, the band auditioned a number of potential guitarists, and eventually settled on <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Shiflett" class="bbcode_artist">Chris Shiflett</a>, who previously performed with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/No+Use+For+A+Name" class="bbcode_artist">No Use For A Name</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Me+First+And+The+Gimme+Gimmes" class="bbcode_artist">Me First And The Gimme Gimmes</a>. Shiflett initially joined the band as touring guitarist, but achieved full-time status prior to the recording of the group\'s fourth album.
 
 That same year, Foo Fighters established a relationship with rock band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen" class="bbcode_artist">Queen</a>, of whom the band (particularly Grohl and Hawkins) are fans. Guitarist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+May" class="bbcode_artist">Brian May</a> added a guitar track to Foo Fighters\' second cover of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd" class="bbcode_artist">Pink Floyd</a>\'s &quot;<a title="Pink Floyd &ndash; Have a Cigar" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Have+a+Cigar" class="bbcode_track">Have a Cigar</a>&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the movie Mission Impossible 2. When <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen" class="bbcode_artist">Queen</a> was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001, Grohl and Hawkins were invited to perform with the band on &quot;<a title="Queen &ndash; Tie Your Mother Down" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Tie+Your+Mother+Down" class="bbcode_track">Tie Your Mother Down</a>&quot;, with Grohl filling in on vocals for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Mercury" class="bbcode_artist">Freddie Mercury</a>. In 2002, guitarist May contributed guitar work to &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Tired Of You" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Tired+Of+You" class="bbcode_track">Tired Of You</a>&quot; and an outtake called &quot;Knucklehead&quot;. The bands have performed together on several occasions since, including VH1 Rock Honors and Foo Fighters\' headlining concert in Hyde Park.
 
 <strong>One by One</strong>
 Near the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record their fourth album. After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, Grohl spent some time helping <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age" class="bbcode_artist">Queens of the Stone Age</a> complete their 2002 album <a title="Queens of the Stone Age - Songs for the Deaf" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age/Songs+for+the+Deaf" class="bbcode_album">Songs for the Deaf</a>. Once the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age" class="bbcode_artist">Queens of the Stone Age</a> album was finished, Grohl, inspired by the sessions, decided to reconvene Foo Fighters to rework a few songs on their album. Instead, they re-recorded nearly all of the album (save &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Tired Of You" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Tired+Of+You" class="bbcode_track">Tired Of You</a>&quot;) in a ten-day stretch at Grohl\'s studio in Virginia. The final album was released in October of 2002 under the title <a title="Foo Fighters - One by One" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/One+by+One" class="bbcode_album">One by One</a>. Singles from the album included &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; All My Life" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/All+My+Life" class="bbcode_track">All My Life</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Times Like These" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Times+Like+These" class="bbcode_track">Times Like These</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Low" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Low" class="bbcode_track">Low</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Have It All" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Have+It+All" class="bbcode_track">Have It All</a>&quot;. The band later expressed displeasure with the album. Grohl told Rolling Stone in 2005, &quot;Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it.&quot;
 
 For most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004 prior to donating 3 million dollars to the new Pittsburgh Penguins arena, upon learning that George W. Bush\'s presidential campaign was using &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Times Like These" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Times+Like+These" class="bbcode_track">Times Like These</a>&quot; at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to John Kerry\'s campaign. Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets. The entire band eventually joined Grohl for a performance in Arizona coinciding with one of the presidential debates.
 
 <strong>In Your Honor and acoustic tour</strong>
 Having spent a year and a half touring behind <a title="Foo Fighters - One by One" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/One+by+One" class="bbcode_album">One by One</a>, Grohl did not want to rush into recording another Foo Fighters record. Initially Grohl intended to write acoustic material by himself, but eventually the project involved the entire band. To record its fifth album, the band shifted to Los Angeles and built a recording studio, dubbed Studio 606 West. Grohl insisted that the album be divided into two discs–one full of rock songs, the other featuring acoustic tracks. <a title="Foo Fighters - In Your Honor" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/In+Your+Honor" class="bbcode_album">In Your Honor</a> was released in June 2005. The album\'s singles included &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Best Of You" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Best+Of+You" class="bbcode_track">Best Of You</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; DOA" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/DOA" class="bbcode_track">DOA</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Resolve" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Resolve" class="bbcode_track">Resolve</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; No Way Back" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/No+Way+Back" class="bbcode_track">No Way Back</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Miracle" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Miracle" class="bbcode_track">Miracle</a>&quot;.
 
 On June 17, 2006, Foo Fighters performed their largest non-festival headlining concert to date at London\'s Hyde Park. The band was supported by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Juliette+and+The+Licks" class="bbcode_artist">Juliette and The Licks</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Angels%2B%2526%2BAirwaves" class="bbcode_artist">Angels &amp; Airwaves</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age" class="bbcode_artist">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mot%C3%B6rhead" class="bbcode_artist">Mot&ouml;rhead</a>. Motörhead\'s Lemmy joined the band on stage to sing &quot;Shake Your Blood&quot; from Dave Grohl\'s Probot album. Also, as a surprise performance, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+May" class="bbcode_artist">Brian May</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Taylor" class="bbcode_artist">Roger Taylor</a> of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen" class="bbcode_artist">Queen</a> jammed with Foo Fighters, playing part of &quot;<a title="Queen &ndash; We Will Rock You" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/We+Will+Rock+You" class="bbcode_track">We Will Rock You</a>&quot; as a lead into &quot;<a title="Queen &ndash; Tie Your Mother Down" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Tie+Your+Mother+Down" class="bbcode_track">Tie Your Mother Down</a>&quot;.
 
 In further support of <a title="Foo Fighters - In Your Honor" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/In+Your+Honor" class="bbcode_album">In Your Honor</a>, the band decided to organize a short acoustic tour for the summer of 2006. The tour included former member <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Smear" class="bbcode_artist">Pat Smear</a>, who rejoined the band as an extra guitarist, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Petra+Haden" class="bbcode_artist">Petra Haden</a> on violin and backup vocals, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Drew+Hester" class="bbcode_artist">Drew Hester</a> on percussion, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rami+Jaffee" class="bbcode_artist">Rami Jaffee</a> of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Wallflowers" class="bbcode_artist">The Wallflowers</a> on keyboards/piano. While much of the setlist focused on <a title="Foo Fighters - In Your Honor" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/In+Your+Honor" class="bbcode_album">In Your Honor</a>\'s acoustic half, the band also used the opportunity to play lesser-known songs such as &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Ain\'t It The Life" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Ain%27t+It+The+Life" class="bbcode_track">Ain\'t It The Life</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Floaty" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Floaty" class="bbcode_track">Floaty</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; See You" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/See+You" class="bbcode_track">See You</a>&quot;. The band also performed &quot;<span title="Unknown track" class="bbcode_unknown">Marigold&quot;, a Pocketwatch-era song that was best-known as a <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a> B-side.
 
 In November 2006, the band released their first ever live CD, <a title="Foo Fighters - Skin And Bones" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Skin+And+Bones" class="bbcode_album">Skin And Bones</a>, featuring fifteen performances captured over a three-night stand in Los Angeles. An accompanying DVD was released, and featured tracks not available on the CD.
 
 <strong>Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace</strong>
 For the follow-up to <a title="Foo Fighters - In Your Honor" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/In+Your+Honor" class="bbcode_album">In Your Honor</a>, the band decided to call in <a title="Foo Fighters - The Colour and the Shape" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/The+Colour+and+the+Shape" class="bbcode_album">The Colour and the Shape</a> producer Gil Norton. <a title="Foo Fighters - Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Echoes%252C%2BSilence%252C%2BPatience%2B%2526%2BGrace" class="bbcode_album">Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace</a> was released in September 2007. The album\'s first single, &quot;The Pretender&quot;, was issued to radio in early August. The second single, &quot;[track artist=Foo Fighters]Long Road to Ruin</span>&quot;, was released in December 2007, supported by a music video directed by longtime collaborator <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jesse+Peretz" class="bbcode_artist">Jesse Peretz</a> (formerly of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Lemonheads" class="bbcode_artist">Lemonheads</a>).
 
 In mid-to-late 2007 &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; The Pretender" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/The+Pretender" class="bbcode_track">The Pretender</a>&quot; topped the Modern Rock chart for a record 18 weeks, it also gave the band their third consecutive year at the top (a record), and made them the only artist besides <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers" class="bbcode_artist">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> to have 4 consecutive albums have songs reach the top (RHCPs have 5). When &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Long Road To Ruin" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Long+Road+To+Ruin" class="bbcode_track">Long Road To Ruin</a>&quot; reached the top it gave them their fourth consecutive year to have a song reach the top (breaking their own record). When the fourth single, &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Let It Die" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Let+It+Die" class="bbcode_track">Let It Die</a>&quot;, reached the top 20 it gave them 3 songs in the top 20, one of only four artists to do this. &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; Let It Die" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Let+It+Die" class="bbcode_track">Let It Die</a>&quot; is also the album\'s third Number One hit on the chart.
 
 Not long after completing the recording sessions for the album, the band participated in Live Earth at Wembley Stadium in London, England, performing the penultimate set of the night. Later that summer, the band headlined V Festival 2007, including a surprise acoustic set on the Channel 4 stage under the name 606. In October 2007, Foo Fighters started their world tour in support for <a title="Foo Fighters - Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Echoes%252C%2BSilence%252C%2BPatience%2B%2526%2BGrace" class="bbcode_album">Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace</a>. The band performed shows throughout the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada and Asia. The band finished its world tour in September 2008 at the Virgin Festival at Toronto Island Park in Canada.
 
 <a title="Foo Fighters - Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Echoes%252C%2BSilence%252C%2BPatience%2B%2526%2BGrace" class="bbcode_album">Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace</a> was nominated for 5 Grammys in 2008. The Foo Fighters went home with Best Rock Album and Best Hard Rock Performance (for &quot;<a title="Foo Fighters &ndash; The Pretender" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/The+Pretender" class="bbcode_track">The Pretender</a>&quot;).

 On 17 September 2008 Dave Grohl announced on The Chris Moyles Show that the band would be taking a long break from music so that they could return with a new sense of purpose, and also informed fans not to expect any new music for a while. &quot;We\'ve never really taken a long break, I think it\'s time,&quot; Grohl commented. &quot;After doing Wembley, we shouldn\'t come back there for 10 years because we\'ve played to everybody. We\'re over in the UK every year, every summer, so I think it\'s time to take a break and come back over when people really miss us.&quot;
 
 <strong> Wasting Light </strong>
 
 After taking a break from music, Foo Fighters returned in 2011 with the album <a title="Foo Fighters - Wasting Light" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Wasting+Light" class="bbcode_album">Wasting Light</a>. The album was recorded in Dave Grohl\'s garage, as opposed to Studio 606. Grohl addressed by stating &quot;There\'s poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a garage.&quot; Wasting Light features many guest musicians, including Krist Novoselic, who had played with Grohl in Nirvana. 
 
 Foo Fighters released a 30 second teaser on January 17th 2011 of the song &quot;Bridge Burning&quot;, and on February 1st 2011 the announcement of the release date of the album, April 12th 2011, was accompanied by a 30 second teaser of &quot;Miss the Misery&quot;. On February 12th, the music video for &quot;White Limo&quot; was released. And on February 23rd &quot;Rope&quot; was released for online streaming. 
 
 On March 1st &quot;Rope&quot; was released as the first single from the album. It peaked at number 1 in the US on the Rock, Alternative, and Mainstream Rock charts.
 
 On April 9th the band appeared on Saturday Night Live (host Helen Miren). They played the song &quot;Rope&quot; for their first performance, and debuted the song &quot;Walk&quot; for their second. 
 
 Wasting Light peaked at number 1 on the Albums chart in 12 countries, including the US and UK. It has achieved platinum status in Australia and New Zeland. 
 
 <strong>Musical style</strong>
 When Grohl first started the band, its music was often compared to that of his previous group, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a>. Grohl acknowledged that <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a> singer/guitarist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kurt+Cobain" class="bbcode_artist">Kurt Cobain</a> was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, &quot;Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that\'s stripped down.&quot; Foo Fighters also utilize the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pixies" class="bbcode_artist">Pixies</a>\' technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud chorus, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana" class="bbcode_artist">Nirvana</a> &quot;liking the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Knack" class="bbcode_artist">Knack</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bay+City+Rollers" class="bbcode_artist">Bay City Rollers</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles" class="bbcode_artist">The Beatles</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/ABBA" class="bbcode_artist">ABBA</a> as much as we liked <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Flipper" class="bbcode_artist">Flipper</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Flag" class="bbcode_artist">Black Flag</a>, I suppose&quot;. Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar similar to how he approached playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, &quot;I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.&quot; Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.
 
 The members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with harder sounds. Grohl noted in 1997, &quot;We all love music, whether it\'s <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles" class="bbcode_artist">The Beatles</a> or <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen" class="bbcode_artist">Queen</a> or <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/punk%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">punk rock</a>. I think the lure of <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/punk%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">punk rock</a> was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we\'re all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.&quot;
 
 <strong>Campaigning and activism</strong>
 In 2000, the band generated controversy through their public support of Alive &amp; Well, an organization that denies the link between HIV and AIDS, questions the validity of HIV tests, and advises against taking medication to counter the disease. Foo Fighter bassist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nate+Mendel" class="bbcode_artist">Nate Mendel</a> learned of Alive &amp; Well through What If Everything You Thought You Knew about AIDS Was Wrong?, a self-published book written by Christine Maggiore, the organization\'s founder. Mendel passed the book around to the rest of the band, who supported his advocacy.
 
 In January 2000, the band played a benefit concert for the organization, which Mendel helped to organize. The band also contributed songs to The Other Side of AIDS, a controversial documentary film by Maggiore\'s husband Robin Scovill, which questions whether HIV is the cause of AIDS. The band\'s position caused alarm in the medical community, as Alive &amp; Well\'s advice ran contrary to established medical wisdom about HIV and AIDS. In a 2000 interview, Mendel spoke of using Foo Fighters\' popularity to help spread the group\'s message and of holding more benefits for the organization. However, no further benefits have taken place, and the band has since removed the organization from its list of supported causes.
